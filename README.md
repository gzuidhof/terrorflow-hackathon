## Description

This repository contains the code for the AIVD (Dutch National Intelligence and Security Agency) hackathon. We created a system for automatic detection of new extremists which may be worth keeping a closer eye on for the AIVD. 

We do this by recognizing certain aspects of images, of which the combination may be especially interesting. For instance, an AK-47 in an image on Instagram is not that interesting, but an AK-47 in a desert environment with a Dutch burning flag may be very interesting. 

This is a multi-label computer vision problem which we tackled with deep learning (convolutional neural networks). 

*The scope of this project was pretty large. Aside from creating the models, we also created a flashy browser front-end and a back-end and deployed it on an 8 GPU AWS instance. This was all created in 24 hours, so don't expect the code to be of high quality.*
